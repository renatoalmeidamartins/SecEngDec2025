## Labs and learning materials
- [Access to labs and course materials](https://us-east-1.student.classrooms.aws.training/class/56ogTfTCX7PudA2chB9UA5). when you open this link, you will be prompted to signin. I have you all signed up using your theocc.com emails. You must then choose One-time email password (preferred) or SSO. The SSO option eventually prevents us from working properly on the labs. If you get an access denied error, let me know the email used to access the class, and I will add you to the class. You can also login using a personal account by choosing "builder id".
